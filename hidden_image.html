    <p>Unicorns are the best animal ever to exist in the planet earth and universe. I want to bawl because I want to see one. Someday I belive I will see one magestically prancing around, it's mane sparkly and with thick eyelashes. They do truly exist in real life and if you say otherwise I will throw a tantrum.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sparkly</li>
        <li>Magestic</li>
        <li>Perfect</li>
        <li>Magical</li>
        <li>Amazing</li>
        <li>The Best</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Those are things about unicorns. Their smooth, perfect hoofs are crazy. Like, how do they do it. Horses don't have that sparkly hoofs unless they get a makeover. Unicorn are just naturally perfect. That is why Santa should give me one as a gift. I would give it water and buy apples with my own money for it. I wuld brush them everyday and clean up any stray hair. I would love them very much. Please give me a unicorn.</p>
